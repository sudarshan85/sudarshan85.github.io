      <description>Introduction This is my second post in a series of six exploring deep learning with structured and unstructured data with the FastAI library. Be sure to check out my post on data preparation. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to describe my efforts in building a deep learning model that only uses structured data. My notebook for building this model can be found here. Much of the material here, including code and ideas, are taken on FastAI&amp;rsquo;s notebook on tabular data with the Rossmann Store Sales Kaggle dataset and the paper titled Entity Embeddings of Categorical Variables  by Cheng Guo and Felix Berkhahn.</description>
